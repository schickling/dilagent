## Reproduction Guidelines

### Core Goal
Create a minimal, reliable reproduction that clearly demonstrates the issue.

### Key Principles

**1. Start Simple, Add Complexity**
- Try local reproduction first
- If that doesn't work, ask what additional setup is needed
- Only add complexity when necessary for reliability

**2. Categorize the Reproduction**
Identify which type best describes your reproduction:

- **Immediate**: Bug appears right away when code runs
  → Focus on minimizing code and measuring execution time
  
- **Delayed**: Bug takes time/iterations/specific conditions to appear  
  → Document minimum conditions to trigger
  → Try to accelerate if possible (but not at expense of reliability)
  
- **Environmental**: Bug requires specific setup/environment
  → Document minimum setup requirements
  → Try to mock/simulate locally when possible

**3. Minimization Strategy**
- Remove code that doesn't affect the bug
- Simplify data structures
- Replace external dependencies with mocks where possible
- BUT: Keep the reproduction reliable above all else

**4. Generate the Reproduction Script**
Use the Write tool to create repro.ts with:

\`\`\`typescript
#!/usr/bin/env node
/**
 * Reproduction Type: [immediate/delayed/environmental]
 * ${isFlaky ? 'Flaky: Yes - may require multiple runs' : 'Deterministic reproduction'}
 * Expected: [what should happen]
 * Actual: [what does happen]
 */

// For immediate bugs - include timing
console.time('Reproduction');
// ... minimal reproduction code ...
console.timeEnd('Reproduction');

// For delayed bugs - document wait time
// Note: Bug manifests after ~X seconds/iterations

// For environmental bugs - document requirements  
// Requires: [specific environment/tools/config]
// To run: [specific commands]

// Clear logging of expected vs actual
console.log('Expected:', expectedBehavior);
console.log('Actual:', actualBehavior);
\`\`\`

### Process Steps:

**1. Explore and Understand**
- List and read all files to understand the codebase structure
- Identify entry points, test files, build scripts, configuration
- Look for existing tests or examples that might be related to the problem

**2. Create and Minimize Reproduction**
- Start with a working reproduction (even if not minimal)
- Test that it reliably reproduces the issue
- Remove unnecessary code while preserving the bug
- Choose appropriate reproduction type (immediate/delayed/environmental)

**3. Use Write Tool to Create Script**
- Generate the final repro.ts using the Write tool
- Include timing measurements for immediate bugs
- Document setup requirements for environmental bugs
- Add clear expected vs actual logging

### What to Include in Response

- **reproductionType**: immediate, delayed, or environmental
- **executionTimeMs**: Include for immediate bugs, omit for others
- **minimizationNotes**: What you removed and ideas for further reduction
- **setupRequirements**: Any special requirements beyond standard tools

### Remember
- Reliability > Minimalism > Speed
- Document anything non-obvious
- If you can't reproduce locally, explain why and what's needed
- Use Write tool to create the actual repro.ts file

CRITICAL: You must respond with ONLY JSON. No explanations. No text before JSON. No text after JSON. Follow the response schema exactly.

Begin your response with {
`

export const refineReproductionPrompt = ({
  problemPrompt,
  contextDirectory,
  isFlaky,
  previousAttempt,
  userFeedback,
}: {
  problemPrompt: string
  contextDirectory: string
  isFlaky: boolean
  previousAttempt: Extract<typeof ReproductionResult.Type, { _tag: 'NeedMoreInfo' }>
  userFeedback: string[]
}) => `\
## Context

<problem>
${problemPrompt}
</problem>

<context-directory>
${contextDirectory}
</context-directory>

<is-flaky>
${isFlaky ? 'true' : 'false'}
</is-flaky>

<previous-attempt>
Questions asked: ${JSON.stringify(previousAttempt.questions, null, 2)}
Context: ${previousAttempt.context}
Attempted approaches: ${JSON.stringify(previousAttempt.attemptedApproaches, null, 2)}

<user-feedback>

## Instructions

Based on the user feedback provided, continue your reproduction efforts. You now have additional context that should help you:

1. **Apply the new information** - Use the user's answers to refine your approach
2. **Try previously blocked approaches** - Attempt methods that were unclear before
3. **Generate improved reproduction** - Create a better repro.ts based on new insights

Follow the same process as before:
- Use tools to implement the reproduction with the new information
- Capture real outputs and behavior
- Generate a comprehensive repro.ts script
- Provide clear expected vs actual behavior documentation

The user has provided specific answers to help you proceed. Use this information to create a successful reproduction.

**Never give up!** If you encounter new blockers, ask more questions via NeedMoreInfo rather than failing.

CRITICAL: You must respond with ONLY JSON. No explanations. No text before JSON. No text after JSON. Follow the response schema exactly.
