# Dilagent File Structure Implementation Plan

## Overview
Implement the new file management structure for Dilagent with comprehensive Effect services, ensuring proper git worktree isolation, state management, and timeline tracking. Implementation will be done **sequentially and carefully** with review checkpoints after each service.

## Key Principles
- **Sequential Implementation**: One service at a time, with review after each
- **Context Immutability**: Original context-dir is NEVER modified
- **Git Worktree Isolation**: Each hypothesis runs in its own worktree
- **Centralized State**: All hypothesis state in `.dilagent/state.json` (single source of truth)
- **Test-Driven Development**: Write tests before implementation

## Phase 1: Core Services (Sequential Implementation)

### ✅ 1.1 WorkingDirService
- **File**: `src/services/working-dir.ts` ✅ **COMPLETED**
- **Purpose**: Manage .dilagent directory structure creation and config file management
- **Implementation Details**:
  ```typescript
  // Key methods:
  ✅ initializeDilagentStructure(workingDir: string): Effect<void, FileSystemError>
  ✅ ensureDirectory(path: string): Effect<void, FileSystemError>
  ✅ createHypothesisDirectory(workingDir: string, hypothesisId: string): Effect<void, FileSystemError>
  ✅ writeConfig(workingDir: string, config: DilagentConfig): Effect<void, FileSystemError>
  ✅ readConfig(workingDir: string): Effect<DilagentConfig, FileSystemError>
  ✅ writeState(workingDir: string, state: DilagentState): Effect<void, FileSystemError>
  ✅ readState(workingDir: string): Effect<DilagentState, FileSystemError>
  ✅ writeTimeline(workingDir: string, timeline: Timeline): Effect<void, FileSystemError>
  ✅ readTimeline(workingDir: string): Effect<Timeline, FileSystemError>
  ```
- **Directory Structure to Create**:
  ```
  .dilagent/
  ├── logs/
  ├── artifacts/
  ├── context-repo/
  ├── config.json
  ├── state.json
  ├── timeline.json
  └── H{NNN}/  (created per hypothesis)
  ```
- **Test**: `src/services/working-dir.test.ts` ✅ **COMPLETED**

- **Implementation**:
  ```typescript
  ✅ generateRunSlug(contextSlug?: string): string
  ✅ parseRunSlug(runSlug: string): { date: string; context?: string }
  ✅ isValidRunSlug(runSlug: string): boolean

  - ✅ Used successfully in git-manager tests
  - ✅ Date formatting verified: YYYY-MM-DD format
  - ✅ Context slug handling working correctly
- **Review Checkpoint**: ✅ **COMPLETED - Ready for next phase**

### ✅ 1.3 GitManagerService ⚠️ CRITICAL

- **Purpose**: Handle all git operations maintaining context immutability
- **Implementation Details**:
  ```typescript
  // Key methods:
  ✅ isGitRepo(path: string): Effect<boolean>
  ✅ getGitRoot(path: string): Effect<string, GitError>  
  ✅ setupContextRepo(contextDir: string, workingDir: string, runSlug: string): Effect<void, GitError>

  ✅ getCurrentBranch(repoPath: string): Effect<string, GitError>
  ```
- **Git Setup Logic**: ✅ **IMPLEMENTED**
  ```bash
  # If context-dir is already a git repo:
  ✅ cd <git-root-of-context-dir>
  ✅ git worktree add -b dilagent/${RUN_SLUG}/root <working-dir>/.dilagent/context-repo HEAD
  
  # If context-dir is NOT a git repo:
  ✅ cp -r <context-dir> <working-dir>/.dilagent/context-repo
  ✅ cd <working-dir>/.dilagent/context-repo
  ✅ git init && git config user.* && git add . && git commit -m "Initial context snapshot"
  ✅ git checkout -b dilagent/${RUN_SLUG}/root
  ```
- **Worktree Creation**: ✅ **IMPLEMENTED**
  ```bash
  ✅ cd <working-dir>/.dilagent/context-repo
  ✅ git worktree add -b dilagent/${RUN_SLUG}/H${NNN}-${HYPOTHESIS_SLUG} \

  ✅ enableAutoFlush() / disableAutoFlush(): Effect<void>
  ✅ updateHypothesis(hypothesisId: string, updates: Partial<HypothesisInfo>): Effect<void, StateStoreError>
  ✅ getDilagentState(): Effect<DilagentState, StateStoreError>
  ✅ updateDilagentState(updateFn: (state: DilagentState) => DilagentState): Effect<void, StateStoreFlushError | StateStoreError>

  - getEvents(filter?: { phase?: string, hypothesisId?: string }): Effect<TimelineEvent[], TimelineError>
  - persistToFile(timelineFile: string): Effect<void, TimelineError>

- **Test**: `src/services/timeline.test.ts`
  - Test event recording
  - Test persistence and loading
  - Test event filtering
  - Test concurrent event recording
- **Review Checkpoint**: Submit for review before proceeding

### ~~2.3 ConfigService~~ ✅ **MERGED INTO WORKINGDIRSERVICE**

  ✅ Verified `.dilagent/context-repo/.git` exists (proper git worktree marker)
  ✅ Logs show: "Created git worktree: .../.dilagent/context-repo (branch: dilagent/2025-09-07-reproduction/root)"

  - Key insights based on results

## Phase 5: Integration & Testing

### 5.1 Integration tests

- **Test Scenarios**:
  - Full flow: reproduction → hypothesis generation → testing
  - State persistence across process restarts
  - Git worktree integrity checks
  - File structure validation
  - Concurrent hypothesis execution (if enabled)

### 5.2 Update existing tests
- Fix any broken tests due to structural changes
- Add mocks for new services where needed
- Ensure all existing functionality still works

### 5.3 Add comprehensive logging
- Update FileLogger to write to `.dilagent/logs/`
- Add structured logging with proper log levels
- Ensure all services log important operations

## Phase 6: Documentation & Cleanup

### 6.1 Update CLI help text
- Update command descriptions
- Add examples with new structure
- Document new options

### 6.2 Remove obsolete code
- Remove old file management code
- Clean up unused imports
- Remove deprecated schemas

### 6.3 Update README
- Document new file structure
- Add architecture diagram
- Update usage examples

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests (Per Service)
- Minimum 80% coverage for critical paths
- Use Effect test utilities
- Mock external dependencies (file system, git)
- Test error scenarios thoroughly

### Integration Tests
- Test complete workflows end-to-end
- Validate file structure after operations
- Test state recovery scenarios
- Verify git operations don't modify source

### Manual Testing Checklist
After each service/command update:
- [ ] Run `pnpm test` - all tests pass
- [ ] Run `tsc --noEmit` - no type errors
- [ ] Run `pnpm lint` - no lint errors
- [ ] Test CLI command manually
- [ ] Verify file structure matches spec
- [ ] Check JSON files are valid
- [ ] Verify git worktrees created correctly
- [ ] Confirm original context unchanged

## Risk Mitigation

### Critical Risks
1. **Context Modification**: GitManager must NEVER modify original context
   - Mitigation: Comprehensive tests, defensive copying
2. **State Corruption**: State must remain consistent
   - Mitigation: Atomic writes, validation, recovery mechanism
3. **Git Operations Failure**: Handle git errors gracefully
   - Mitigation: Proper error types, fallback strategies

### Rollback Strategy
- Keep old code paths during transition
- Feature flag for new file structure
- Ability to revert to previous version

## Success Criteria

- [ ] All CLI commands work with new structure
- [ ] Git worktrees properly isolate hypotheses
- [ ] State auto-flushes reliably
- [ ] Timeline captures all events
- [ ] All tests pass (unit + integration)
- [ ] File structure matches specification exactly
- [ ] No regression in functionality
- [ ] Original context never modified
- [ ] Performance acceptable (< 2s overhead)

## Review Checkpoints

After each major component:
1. Code review for design and implementation
2. Test coverage review
3. Manual testing verification
4. Documentation review
5. Performance check

## Notes for Implementation

- Use `Command` from `@effect/platform` for all shell/git operations
- Use Effect's file system utilities for all file operations
- Ensure all paths are resolved to absolute paths
- Add comprehensive error messages with context
- Use structured logging throughout
- Consider concurrent operations carefully
- Always validate external data (files, git output)

## Questions to Resolve

1. Should we support resuming interrupted runs?
2. How to handle hypothesis cleanup on failure?
3. Should we add a cleanup command to remove worktrees?
4. Do we need log rotation for long-running sessions?
5. Should state.json be pretty-printed for readability?
